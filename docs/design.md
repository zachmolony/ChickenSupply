# Design documentation

### Concept 

I chose to have my route to my favourite chicken shop, as I am good friends with the owner and have been a long time fan of the quality food. I build this app to share my love of Dallas and make it easy as possible for everyone to find good quality chicken. 

### Visual design

I decided to use a combination of the Google colour scheme, and colours from the Dallas Chicken and Ribs logo. I am using the Google Yellow, and red and blue from Dallas. I am using bootstrap to enhance my front end, and will be including jQuery animations to make the app look more polished.
